# TO-DO APP W/ CREATE-REACT-APP #

- This is a basic To-Do app using exclusively Create-React-App.
- Because it's a frontend only app, it will not persist if the app is refreshed.
- Will be deployed using Netlify when I feel as though it is good enough.

## HOW TO RUN

- To use locally, clone this repo and cd into the todo folder
- Run the app with 'npm start'

## USER EXPERIENCE

- Add a task with the input box. It will show on the page after it is submitted.
- To show that a task has been completed, click the checkbox next to the task.
- Tasks can be deleted and edited
- The tabs above can show all tasks, completed tasks (those with checkmarks), or uncompleted tasks (those without checkmarks)
